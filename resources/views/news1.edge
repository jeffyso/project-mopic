            Jared Leto has confirmed that he will star in Tron 3. 
            The original Tron hit theaters in 1982, starred Jeff Bridges,
            and gave way for a new cinematic world. 
            
            The sequel, Tron: Legacy, was a more financial 
            success than a critical one, and it starred 
            Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde in lead roles, 
            with Jeff Bridges returning as well. While promising 
            reports of a third film have been floating around 
            since 2017, it was not developed quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                With Disney being the owner of the Tron 
                property, it only makes sense that they 
                would look to revive the franchise amidst 
                the growing interest to revive older franchises. 
                And clearly, despite Tron: Legacy coming out ten 
                years ago, there is still a large fanbase for 
                the franchise. Rumors of a film bringing back 
                the characters from Legacy began to surface in 2010, 
                but the project was eventually scrapped. 
                Then, coming off of the positive reviews of 
                Blade Runner 2049, Leto became attached to the movie 
                in 2017.

       Now, Leto himself has confirmed on Instagram 
       that he will be starring in the franchise's newest 
       chapter. Leto confirmed his involvement while also 
       revealing that the people involved with Tron 3 have 
       some exciting things planned for the next film in the 
       series.
